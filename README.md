## Overview

This exploratory analysis showcases the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services, as well asdetermine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Resources

## Results

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

As seen in Figure 1 below, urban cities have the highest number of total rides compared to suburban and rural cities. Furthermore, there is a negative correlation between average fare per ride
